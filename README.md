# NSFW AI Tagging: Enhance Your Local Content Organization

This project is dedicated to creating and running AI models that can automatically select appropriate tags for images and videos (including at specific timestamps). Having this tag data for images and videos can provide invaluable information to help manage content and find content without spending manual time hunting for the right videos or images.

## Key Benefits of NSFW Tagging AI

The AI models available here are state-of-the-art, boasting far higher accuracy than any other NSFW AI models found on the internet. These models provide data that can be useful in many ways:

* **Precision Time-Based Tagging**
  - The AI delivers highly accurate time-based tags, making it easy for you to search and find specific content within a video without having to watch the entire video to locate the interesting parts.

* **Enhanced Searchability**
  - By generating detailed tags, the AI helps you quickly locate desired images and videos, saving you time in finding that right video.

* **Improved Content Management**
  - Using the AI results, you can better organize your content library, easily categorize content, delete unwanted content, and find what you want when you want it.

* **Future Content Recommendations**
  - As these AI models progress and more models are released covering additional tags, the data will be useful for content recommendation systems. These will allow you to find new content that aligns with your interests based on what you already like.

## Available Tags
The main difference between the free model and the patreon models is the number of supported tags. See the supported tags of the free and Patreon models below along with a rough plan for future tags that will be added in the future:

Current total supported tags: **151**

## Limitations

Before becoming a patron or installing the free model, please be aware of the following limitations:

- **Usage Restrictions**: This code and associated models can only be used for personal local use as per the license. For any for-profit use cases or use cases that require online deployment, [please contact](https://discord.gg/EvYbZBf) me for licensing options.

- **Hardware Requirements**: Only NVIDIA GPUs are supported. Any NVIDIA GPUs older than the NVIDIA 1080 will likely not work. Support for AMD GPUs is not planned.

- **Performance on CPU**: While CPU is supported, it will be much slower compared to running on a GPU.

- **Complexity and Support**: Running machine learning models is complex and requires precise conditions to work smoothly. Although I have worked to make the installation process and AI model predictions as user-friendly as possible, due to the variability in hardware and software environments, there might be issues. I will do my best to help resolve any issues, but I cannot guarantee that the models will run on every computer.

- **Model Access**: The most capable models are for paid patrons only because this project takes an enormous amount of time, and Patreon funds future development. There is a free model available with less tags for users that may not care about all the tags or want to try the AI before considering becoming a patron.

## Free Open Source vs Paid Models

This project includes both a free open source AI model as well as several paid Patreon only models. The free AI model supports [10 tags](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MbULbXaUMjvuGo066SuPaJVjBSSA57jhS3DAtvWNpwI/edit?usp=sharing) compared to the [151 overall](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MbULbXaUMjvuGo066SuPaJVjBSSA57jhS3DAtvWNpwI/edit?usp=sharing) in the Patreon models. The paid version also includes different model variations that have different tradeoffs between accuracy and speed as well as more AI models for additional tag categories. You can see the list of currently available models here:
