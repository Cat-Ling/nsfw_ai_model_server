# NSFW AI Model Server

This repository is designed for hosting a local HTTP server to access state-of-the-art NSFW AI models created by [Skier](https://www.patreon.com/Skier). You will need to be a patron to get access to these models to be able to use them with this repository or use the free AI model.

The code here is built to be both fast, easy to install, and extendable.

## Limitations

Before becoming a patron or installing the free model, please be aware of the following limitations:

- As per the license, this code and associated models can only be used for personal local uses. For any for-profit use-cases or use-cases that need to be on the internet, [please contact](https://discord.gg/EvYbZBf) me for licensing options.

- Only NVIDIA GPUs are supported. Any Nvidia GPUs older than NVIDIA1080 will likely not work. Support for AMD GPUs is not planned.

- CPU is supported but it will be much slower than running on GPU.

- The nature of running machine learning models is very complex and requires everything to go precisely right to work smoothly. I've worked to make the installation process and AI model predictions as easy to use as possible but please understand that due to many people on different computers with different graphics cards and many other factors, there is a possibility you will run into issues. I will be here to help as best as I can to work through any of those issues, but I cannot guarantee that the models will be able to run on your computer.
