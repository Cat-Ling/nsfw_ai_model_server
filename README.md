# NSFW AI Tagging: Enhance Your Local Content Organization
This project is dedicated to creating and running AI models that can select appropriate tags for images and videos (including at timestamps in videos). Having this tag data for images and videos can provide invaluable information that can help manage content and find content without spending manual time hunting for the right videos or images.

### Key Benefits of NSFW Tagging AI
The AI Models available here are state-of-the-art boasting far higher accuracy than any other NSFW AI models anywhere on the internet. These models provide data which can be useful in many ways:
* **Precision Time-Based Tagging**
  - The AI delivers highly accurate time-based tags, making it easy for you to search and find specific content within a video without having to watch a full video to find the interesting action.
* **Enhanced Searchability**
  - By generating detailed tags, the AI helps you quickly locate desired images and videos, saving you time finding that right video.
* **Improved Content Management**
  - Using the AI results, you can better organize your content library and easily categorize content, delete unwanted content, and enable making it easier to find what you want, when you want.
* **Future Content Recommendation**
  - As these AI Models progress and more models are released covering even more tags, this data will be useful for content recommendation which will allow you to find new content that you would like based on content that you know you like already.

## Limitations

Before becoming a patron or installing the free model, please be aware of the following limitations:

- As per the license, this code and associated models can only be used for personal local uses. For any for-profit use-cases or use-cases that need to be on the internet, [please contact](https://discord.gg/EvYbZBf) me for licensing options.

- Only NVIDIA GPUs are supported. Any Nvidia GPUs older than NVIDIA1080 will likely not work. Support for AMD GPUs is not planned.

- CPU is supported but it will be much slower than running on GPU.

- The nature of running machine learning models is very complex and requires everything to go precisely right to work smoothly. I've worked to make the installation process and AI model predictions as easy to use as possible but please understand that due to many people on different computers with different graphics cards and many other factors, there is a possibility you will run into issues. I will be here to help as best as I can to work through any of those issues, but I cannot guarantee that the models will be able to run on your computer.
